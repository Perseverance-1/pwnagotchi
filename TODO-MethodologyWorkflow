Pentest Methodology TODO list

Other notes:
-Calculate proper reward values
-Stealthy, noisey? Highter reward based off most stealthy?
-Anonsurf, Streisand? 
-Higher reward for faster exploit
-Add SDR functionality?
-Fluxion functionality?

    Vuln Scan:
        Find most effective route. OpenVAS?
    Run scanned items through exploit db:
        use top 5 exploits that match closest to parameters?
    Exploit:
        Auto compile from Exploitdb or keep local and execute?
        Machine creds
            from exploit or sniffing
    Create shell:
